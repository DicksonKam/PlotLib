## Update History

- [2025-06-08 10:37:08 AM] [Unknown User] - Fixed title + subplots centering calculations: Resolved the centering issue where the "title + subplots" group was not properly centered, especially for layouts like 3x2 where the title appeared too low. Completely rewrote the positioning calculation logic in SubplotManager::render_to_context() to: 1) Calculate actual title height dynamically using Cairo text extents, 2) Compute precise grid dimensions and total content height, 3) Calculate proper centering offsets for the entire "title + subplots" group, 4) Position title at the top of the centered content group, 5) Position subplot grid below title with proper spacing. Removed all arbitrary numbers and made all calculations based on input parameters. Also simplified the constructor to avoid premature positioning calculations.
- [2025-06-08 10:31:45 AM] [Unknown User] - Created centralized plotting library demonstration: Successfully created a comprehensive centralized demo script (centralized_demo.cpp) that demonstrates all plotting library functionality with various subplot dimensions including 1x6, 3x2, 6x1, 2x3, and 4x2 layouts. The demo showcases single plots, cluster visualization, and comprehensive subplot testing. Cleaned up the project by removing unnecessary C++ scripts (comprehensive_subplot_test.cpp, subplot_example.cpp, cluster_example.cpp, example_usage.cpp, main.cpp, test_subplot_scaling.cpp) and compiled binaries. Created a Makefile for easy compilation and updated the README.md to reflect the new centralized structure. The centralized demo tests the title + subplots positioning and overlay functionality across different layout dimensions.
- [2025-06-08 10:19:02 AM] [Unknown User] - Implemented precise title height calculation and dynamic positioning: Resolved excessive white space issues by implementing dynamic positioning calculations: 1) Created get_title_height() method to measure actual title dimensions using Cairo text extents, 2) Moved positioning calculations from constructor to render_to_context() method for access to Cairo context, 3) Recalculate subplot positions during rendering with precise title height, 4) Eliminated fixed title height estimates that caused excessive spacing, 5) Ensured proper vertical centering of entire 'title + subplots' group with minimal white space. Now the subplot layouts are optimally centered regardless of title presence or length.
- [2025-06-08 10:15:47 AM] [Unknown User] - Fixed vertical centering of title and subplot groups: Resolved vertical positioning issues where the entire 'title + subplots' group was not properly centered within the canvas: 1) Calculated total content height including title and subplot grid, 2) Implemented proper vertical centering offset for the entire group, 3) Applied consistent positioning logic to both title and subplots, 4) Eliminated excessive white space above or below the content in different layout configurations. Now the entire subplot figure is properly centered regardless of layout dimensions (1x6, 3x2, 6x1, etc.).
- [2025-06-08 10:07:23 AM] [Unknown User] - Created comprehensive subplot stress tests: Developed extensive test suite covering edge cases and varied scenarios: 1) 1x4 layout with micro/macro scale data, exponential distributions, and incremental patterns, 2) 3x2 layout with multi-clustering, sparse/dense data, extreme ranges, logarithmic and circular patterns, 3) Ultra-wide (1x6) and ultra-tall (6x1) layouts testing extreme aspect ratios, 4) 2x3 mixed layout with negative values, zero-centered, positive-only, time series, clustering, and random walk data. Tests verify aspect ratio preservation, centering, positioning accuracy, and consistent appearance across all layout configurations.
- [2025-06-08 10:02:09 AM] [Unknown User] - Implemented proper aspect ratio preservation for subplots: Fixed aspect ratio distortion in subplots by implementing uniform scaling: 1) Calculate both width and height scale factors, 2) Use the smaller scale factor to preserve aspect ratio, 3) Center subplots within their allocated space using offset calculations, 4) Apply uniform scaling to both width and height dimensions. This prevents "thin" or "tall" looking subplots in wide (1x3) or tall (3x1) layouts while maintaining proper proportions.
- [2025-06-08 9:58:44 AM] [Unknown User] - Fixed subplot scaling and positioning issues: Resolved critical subplot scaling and positioning problems: 1) Fixed incorrect scaling calculations that were distorting aspect ratios, 2) Corrected positioning logic to eliminate consistent directional shifts, 3) Removed problematic margin adjustments that compounded scaling issues, 4) Implemented proper Cairo transformation matrix handling with translate-then-scale approach, 5) Standardized subplot creation with consistent 800x600 base size and proper scaling factors, 6) Fixed spacing calculations for proper grid layout, 7) Created comprehensive test suite to verify scaling consistency and positioning accuracy. All subplots now maintain proper aspect ratios and are correctly centered.
- [2025-06-08 9:51:21 AM] [Unknown User] - Successfully implemented comprehensive subplot functionality: Enhanced the scatter plot library with full subplot support: 1) SubplotManager class for creating MxN grid layouts (2x2, 1x2, 2x1, etc.), 2) Each subplot maintains complete functionality (titles, legends, axes, clustering, etc.), 3) Automatic scaling and positioning with configurable spacing, 4) Main title support for entire figure, 5) Independent data management for each subplot, 6) Cairo transformation matrix handling for proper rendering, 7) Friend class access for private methods, 8) Comprehensive examples demonstrating 2x2, 1x2, and 2x1 layouts. Created subplot_example.cpp with dashboard-style visualizations.
- [2025-06-08 9:41:15 AM] [Unknown User] - Successfully implemented cluster-based visualization with automatic coloring: Enhanced the scatter plot library with cluster-based visualization features: 1) Automatic color assignment for clusters (0,1,2,...) using a 15-color palette, 2) Red crosses for outliers (label -1), 3) Proper rendering order (outliers in background, clusters in foreground), 4) Automatic legend generation with cluster names and outlier identification, 5) Support for both batch and incremental cluster data addition, 6) Comprehensive documentation and examples. Created cluster_example.cpp demonstrating DBSCAN-style clustering results.
- [2025-06-08 9:30:22 AM] [Unknown User] - Successfully enhanced scatter plot library with all requested features: Enhanced the C++ scatter plot library with: 1) Automatic axis labeling and title support, 2) Automatic axis tick generation with proper scaling, 3) Legend support in top-right corner, 4) Series-based data management, 5) Backward compatibility, 6) Professional grid lines aligned with ticks, 7) Comprehensive documentation and examples. Created README.md and example_usage.cpp for easy adoption by other users.
- [2025-06-08 9:14:50 AM] [Unknown User] - Fixed compilation issues and successfully ran C++ scatter plot project: Fixed Cairo header include path from 'cairo/cairo.h' to 'cairo.h', added cairo-svg.h header for SVG support, compiled with both cairo and cairo-svg libraries, and successfully generated scatter plot PNG and SVG files
