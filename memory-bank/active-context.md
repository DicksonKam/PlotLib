## Current Session Notes

- [12:13:41 PM] [Unknown User] Successfully implemented HistogramPlot and demonstrated all three plot types working together: Created a complete HistogramPlot implementation following the PlotManager architecture pattern. Key features: 1) Full histogram functionality with automatic binning using Sturges' rule, custom bin specification, normalization to probability density, and cumulative distribution options, 2) Comprehensive data handling with multiple histogram series support, 3) Advanced features including statistics calculation (mean, std dev), custom bin counts, and proper legend integration, 4) Seamless integration with SubplotManager allowing mixing of histogram, line, and scatter plots in the same subplot grid, 5) Created extensive test suite demonstrating all three plot types working together in various configurations (3x1, 1x3, 2x3 layouts), 6) All existing functionality (centralized demo, line plot demo) continues to work perfectly. The architecture successfully supports heterogeneous plot types in subplots with consistent styling, legend management, and coordinate transformations.
- [12:08:23 PM] [Unknown User] Successfully implemented and tested mixed plot types in subplots: Verified that the PlotManager architecture fully supports mixing different plot types (scatter plots and line plots) within the same subplot grid. Created comprehensive test suite covering: 1) 2x2 mixed layout with scatter and line plots, 2) 3x2 dashboard with alternating plot types, 3) 1x4 horizontal strip with mixed types, 4) 4x1 vertical stack with mixed types, 5) Mixed plots with custom legend configurations (selective hiding, disabled legends). All tests pass successfully, demonstrating that the architecture properly handles different plot types with their own rendering methods while maintaining consistent subplot positioning, scaling, and legend functionality. The template-based SubplotManager::get_subplot<T>() method works correctly for both ScatterPlot and LinePlot types.
- [12:03:41 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed legend box and added selective legend functionality: Successfully restored the missing legend background box that existed in the old implementation and added comprehensive selective legend functionality. Key improvements: 1) Added legend background box with white background (90% opacity) and black border (30% opacity) matching the old implementation, 2) Implemented selective legend options with methods: set_legend_enabled(), hide_legend_item(), show_legend_item(), show_all_legend_items(), 3) Updated legend drawing to skip hidden items and respect the show_legend flag, 4) Enhanced legend to properly handle both regular series and cluster data with appropriate markers (circles for clusters, crosses for outliers), 5) Added comprehensive test suite demonstrating all legend functionality including full legends, selective hiding, disabled legends, cluster legends, and subplot combinations. All tests pass and the centralized demo continues to work correctly.
- [11:49:56 AM] [Unknown User] Fixed scatter plot functionality to match original implementation: Successfully restored the exact functionality of the original scatter_plot implementation by fixing the PlotManager architecture. Key changes: 1) Updated PlotManager::render_to_context() to use Cairo transformation matrix (cairo_save, cairo_translate, cairo_scale, cairo_restore) instead of manual coordinate calculations, 2) Removed subplot-specific coordinate calculations from all drawing methods (transform_point, draw_axes, draw_axis_ticks, draw_grid, draw_axis_labels, draw_title, draw_legend), 3) Simplified drawing methods to use standard coordinates that get transformed by Cairo matrix, 4) Now the plot_manager + scatter_plot combination exactly matches the original scatter_plot functionality with proper subplot positioning, scaling, and rendering. All tests pass and the centralized demo works correctly.
- [11:39:56 AM] [Unknown User] Fixed subplot positioning to match original scatter_plot functionality: Successfully restored the exact subplot positioning logic from the original scatter_plot implementation. The issue was that the current plot_manager SubplotManager::render_to_context() method was using simplified positioning logic instead of the sophisticated centering calculations from the original. Fixed by: 1) Replacing the simple title positioning (y=30) with dynamic centering calculations, 2) Implementing proper "title + subplots" group centering with aspect ratio preservation, 3) Adding uniform scaling with proper subplot centering within allocated space, 4) Restoring the original title height calculation with minimal padding, 5) Moving positioning calculations from template get_subplot() to dynamic render_to_context() method. Now the plot_manager + scatter_plot combination exactly matches the original scatter_plot functionality with proper subplot title positioning and no positioning bugs.
- [11:32:55 AM] [Unknown User] Successfully implemented and tested LinePlot with mixed subplot functionality: Completed LinePlot implementation and demonstrated mixed plot types in subplots. The line_plot_demo.cpp successfully generated three demonstrations: 1) Basic line plots with multiple mathematical functions, 2) Line plots with markers, 3) Mixed plot types in 2x2 subplots combining ScatterPlot and LinePlot. The PlotManager architecture enables seamless mixing of different plot types in the same subplot layout using template-based SubplotManager. All plots inherit common functionality (axes, legends, titles) while implementing their specific drawing logic. Both line_plot_demo and centralized_demo executables run successfully, generating comprehensive visualizations.
- [11:26:51 AM] [Unknown User] Implemented plot_manager architecture: Successfully refactored the plotting library to use a centralized PlotManager base class. Created plot_manager.h/cpp with all common plotting functionality (axes, legends, titles, data bounds, transformations, rendering coordination). Refactored scatter_plot.h/cpp to inherit from PlotManager and only contain scatter-specific functionality. All existing functionality preserved with backward compatibility. All tests pass (11/11) and centralized demo works correctly. Ready for line_plot implementation.
- [11:04:04 AM] [Unknown User] Completed professional library restructuring: Successfully restructured the plotting library into a professional C++ library format with: 1) Standard directory structure (include/, src/, examples/, tests/, docs/, cmake/), 2) CMake build system with proper Cairo linking, 3) Professional project files (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, .gitignore, CI workflow), 4) Working unit tests with 11/11 tests passing, 5) Functional centralized demo generating all 8 plot types, 6) Convenience build script and documentation, 7) Proper header include paths (plotlib/scatter_plot.h), 8) GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for multiple platforms. The library is now ready for professional use and extension with additional plot types beyond scatter plots.
- [10:44:24 AM] [Unknown User] Added comprehensive 2x2 subplot demonstration: Successfully added an additional 2x2 subplot layout demonstration to the centralized demo. The new 2x2 layout includes four comprehensive subplots with sufficient data: 1) Statistical distributions comparison (120 normal + 100 uniform points), 2) Clustering analysis with 3 clusters + outliers (K-means style), 3) Mathematical functions (sine, cosine, polynomial with 60+ points each), 4) Time series analysis (trend, seasonal, noisy data with 80 points each). This brings the total demonstrations to 8 different layouts: single plot, cluster visualization, 1x6, 3x2, 6x1, 2x3, 4x2, and 2x2. All layouts demonstrate proper centering and comprehensive plotting library functionality.
- [10:42:05 AM] [Unknown User] Rolled back to stable version with good centering: Reverted the recent aspect ratio-aware centering changes that were causing issues and returned to the previous stable version. The current implementation provides good centering for most layouts (6x1, 2x3, 4x2, 3x2) and is working well. While the 1x6 layout may have some extra spacing below, the overall functionality is stable and the centralized demo successfully demonstrates all plotting library features across various subplot dimensions. The library now has proper dynamic title positioning and centering calculations without arbitrary numbers.
- [10:40:35 AM] [Unknown User] Fixed aspect ratio-aware centering for ultra-wide layouts: Resolved the excessive spacing issue in ultra-wide layouts like 1x6 by making the centering calculation aware of aspect ratio preservation. The problem was that the centering used allocated subplot dimensions rather than actual rendered dimensions. Fixed by: 1) Pre-calculating the uniform scale factor for aspect ratio preservation, 2) Computing actual rendered subplot dimensions (800 * scale, 600 * scale), 3) Using actual rendered dimensions for grid size calculations and positioning, 4) This ensures that ultra-wide layouts like 1x6 are properly centered without excessive vertical spacing. Now all layout dimensions (1x6, 3x2, 6x1, 2x3, 4x2) have proper centering of the entire "title + subplots" group.
- [10:37:08 AM] [Unknown User] Fixed title + subplots centering calculations: Resolved the centering issue where the "title + subplots" group was not properly centered, especially for layouts like 3x2 where the title appeared too low. Completely rewrote the positioning calculation logic in SubplotManager::render_to_context() to: 1) Calculate actual title height dynamically using Cairo text extents, 2) Compute precise grid dimensions and total content height, 3) Calculate proper centering offsets for the entire "title + subplots" group, 4) Position title at the top of the centered content group, 5) Position subplot grid below title with proper spacing. Removed all arbitrary numbers and made all calculations based on input parameters. Also simplified the constructor to avoid premature positioning calculations.
- [10:31:45 AM] [Unknown User] Created centralized plotting library demonstration: Successfully created a comprehensive centralized demo script (centralized_demo.cpp) that demonstrates all plotting library functionality with various subplot dimensions including 1x6, 3x2, 6x1, 2x3, and 4x2 layouts. The demo showcases single plots, cluster visualization, and comprehensive subplot testing. Cleaned up the project by removing unnecessary C++ scripts (comprehensive_subplot_test.cpp, subplot_example.cpp, cluster_example.cpp, example_usage.cpp, main.cpp, test_subplot_scaling.cpp) and compiled binaries. Created a Makefile for easy compilation and updated the README.md to reflect the new centralized structure. The centralized demo tests the title + subplots positioning and overlay functionality across different layout dimensions.
- [10:19:02 AM] [Unknown User] Implemented precise title height calculation and dynamic positioning: Resolved excessive white space issues by implementing dynamic positioning calculations: 1) Created get_title_height() method to measure actual title dimensions using Cairo text extents, 2) Moved positioning calculations from constructor to render_to_context() method for access to Cairo context, 3) Recalculate subplot positions during rendering with precise title height, 4) Eliminated fixed title height estimates that caused excessive spacing, 5) Ensured proper vertical centering of entire 'title + subplots' group with minimal white space. Now the subplot layouts are optimally centered regardless of title presence or length.
- [10:15:47 AM] [Unknown User] Fixed vertical centering of title and subplot groups: Resolved vertical positioning issues where the entire 'title + subplots' group was not properly centered within the canvas: 1) Calculated total content height including title and subplot grid, 2) Implemented proper vertical centering offset for the entire group, 3) Applied consistent positioning logic to both title and subplots, 4) Eliminated excessive white space above or below the content in different layout configurations. Now the entire subplot figure is properly centered regardless of layout dimensions (1x6, 3x2, 6x1, etc.).
- [10:07:23 AM] [Unknown User] Created comprehensive subplot stress tests: Developed extensive test suite covering edge cases and varied scenarios: 1) 1x4 layout with micro/macro scale data, exponential distributions, and incremental patterns, 2) 3x2 layout with multi-clustering, sparse/dense data, extreme ranges, logarithmic and circular patterns, 3) Ultra-wide (1x6) and ultra-tall (6x1) layouts testing extreme aspect ratios, 4) 2x3 mixed layout with negative values, zero-centered, positive-only, time series, clustering, and random walk data. Tests verify aspect ratio preservation, centering, positioning accuracy, and consistent appearance across all layout configurations.
- [10:02:09 AM] [Unknown User] Implemented proper aspect ratio preservation for subplots: Fixed aspect ratio distortion in subplots by implementing uniform scaling: 1) Calculate both width and height scale factors, 2) Use the smaller scale factor to preserve aspect ratio, 3) Center subplots within their allocated space using offset calculations, 4) Apply uniform scaling to both width and height dimensions. This prevents "thin" or "tall" looking subplots in wide (1x3) or tall (3x1) layouts while maintaining proper proportions.
- [9:58:44 AM] [Unknown User] Fixed subplot scaling and positioning issues: Resolved critical subplot scaling and positioning problems: 1) Fixed incorrect scaling calculations that were distorting aspect ratios, 2) Corrected positioning logic to eliminate consistent directional shifts, 3) Removed problematic margin adjustments that compounded scaling issues, 4) Implemented proper Cairo transformation matrix handling with translate-then-scale approach, 5) Standardized subplot creation with consistent 800x600 base size and proper scaling factors, 6) Fixed spacing calculations for proper grid layout, 7) Created comprehensive test suite to verify scaling consistency and positioning accuracy. All subplots now maintain proper aspect ratios and are correctly centered.
- [9:51:21 AM] [Unknown User] Successfully implemented comprehensive subplot functionality: Enhanced the scatter plot library with full subplot support: 1) SubplotManager class for creating MxN grid layouts (2x2, 1x2, 2x1, etc.), 2) Each subplot maintains complete functionality (titles, legends, axes, clustering, etc.), 3) Automatic scaling and positioning with configurable spacing, 4) Main title support for entire figure, 5) Independent data management for each subplot, 6) Cairo transformation matrix handling for proper rendering, 7) Friend class access for private methods, 8) Comprehensive examples demonstrating 2x2, 1x2, and 2x1 layouts. Created subplot_example.cpp with dashboard-style visualizations.
- [9:41:15 AM] [Unknown User] Successfully implemented cluster-based visualization with automatic coloring: Enhanced the scatter plot library with cluster-based visualization features: 1) Automatic color assignment for clusters (0,1,2,...) using a 15-color palette, 2) Red crosses for outliers (label -1), 3) Proper rendering order (outliers in background, clusters in foreground), 4) Automatic legend generation with cluster names and outlier identification, 5) Support for both batch and incremental cluster data addition, 6) Comprehensive documentation and examples. Created cluster_example.cpp demonstrating DBSCAN-style clustering results.
- [9:30:22 AM] [Unknown User] Successfully enhanced scatter plot library with all requested features: Enhanced the C++ scatter plot library with: 1) Automatic axis labeling and title support, 2) Automatic axis tick generation with proper scaling, 3) Legend support in top-right corner, 4) Series-based data management, 5) Backward compatibility, 6) Professional grid lines aligned with ticks, 7) Comprehensive documentation and examples. Created README.md and example_usage.cpp for easy adoption by other users.
- [9:14:50 AM] [Unknown User] Fixed compilation issues and successfully ran C++ scatter plot project: Fixed Cairo header include path from 'cairo/cairo.h' to 'cairo.h', added cairo-svg.h header for SVG support, compiled with both cairo and cairo-svg libraries, and successfully generated scatter plot PNG and SVG files
