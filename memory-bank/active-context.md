## Current Session Notes

- [5:36:18 PM] [Unknown User] Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow debugging: Fixed multiple issues in CI workflow: removed duplicate libcairo2-dev package, made nproc command more portable with fallback, and added Cairo detection debugging to identify Ubuntu build failures. The workflow should now provide better diagnostic information.
- [5:32:25 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed GitHub Actions workflow deprecation warnings: Updated .github/workflows/ci.yml to use actions/upload-artifact@v4 and actions/checkout@v4 instead of deprecated v3 versions. This resolves the GitHub Actions deprecation warning that was causing workflow failures.
